The majority of all expenses have been funded by founders of the project since its inception. The project is far from achieving any sort of financial sustainability. The current level of voluntary donations falls significantly short of covering efforts needed to sustain the app. Any new developments of features are beyond the scope of possibility due to the absence of the necessary financial resources.

Please consider [donating](https://organicmaps.app/donate) if you want to see this open-source project thriving, not dying. There are [other ways how to support the project](#contributing). No coding skills required.
