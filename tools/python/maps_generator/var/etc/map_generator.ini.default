[External]
# Planet file location. It should be a dump of OSM data in osm.pbf format.
# By default its an entire planet from "planet.openstreetmap.org".
# Or set it to a particular country/region extract from e.g. [Geofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/index.html).
# Note that an entire planet generation takes 40+ hours on a 256GB RAM server (and 1TB+ disk space).
# Stick to smaller extracts unless you have a machine this large.
# Here and further, its possible to specify either an URL (to be downloaded automatically)
# or a local file path like file:///path/to/file.
# A sample URL to download a latest OSM dump for North Macedonia:
PLANET_URL: https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/macedonia-latest.osm.pbf
# Location of the md5 checksum of the planet file:
PLANET_MD5_URL: ${External:PLANET_URL}.md5
# A base url to the latest_coasts.geom and latest_coasts.rawgeom files.
# For example, if PLANET_COASTS_URL = https://somesite.com/download/
# then the https://somesite.com/download/latest_coasts.geom url will be used to download latest_coasts.geom and
# the https://somesite.com/download/latest_coasts.rawgeom url will be used to download latest_coasts.rawgeom.
# Comment to skip getting the coastlines files.
# PLANET_COASTS_URL:
# Should be 'true' for an entire planet build to make a special routing section in World.mwm
# for alerting about absent regions without which the route can't be built.

# Subway file location, see docs/SUBWAY_GENERATION.md if you want to generate your own file.
