Items in the Preferences can have space reserved for an icon. As none of the
settings currently have associated icons, this leads to items that seem indented
without purpose. This wastes space and can lead to truncation of the item names
and descriptions. See https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/issues/1872

To rectify this, the iconSpaceReserved property needs to be set to false.
According to https://developer.android.com/reference/android/preference/Preference#attr_android:iconSpaceReserved
false should be the default. However, according to
https://material.io/design/platform-guidance/android-settings.html this goes
against the material design guidelines and the default was overridden to true in
https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/android-9.0.0_r1:prebuilts/sdk/current/support/v7/preference/res/values-sw360dp-v13/values-sw360dp-v13.xml
This file sets the default value back to false (i.e. no space reserved for icons).
