Organic Maps is a fast, detailed offline map and GPS navigation app for travel, hiking, trekking, and cycling adventures. Plan, import, and record routes, and enjoy smooth guidance without draining your battery or using an internet connection. Explore places and navigate safely during your outdoor adventures and travels around the world. The app offers unlimited map downloads and biweekly updates. OpenStreetMap-based, volunteer-made, privacy-first, 100% offline, and 100% free.

<b>OFFLINE:</b> The app works 100% offline — including search and navigation. You can explore the map and navigate without an internet connection, saving on mobile data and roaming fees. And with no background data transfers, your battery lasts much longer.

<b>FAST:</b> Zooming, search, and route calculations work noticeably fast.

<b>DETAILED & UPDATED:</b> The maps are rich in detail and refreshed twice a month to reflect real-world conditions. Unlike many well-known competitors, they include building labels, benches, hiking paths, and other helpful information.

<b>OPENSTREETMAP-BASED:</b> OpenStreetMap is a wiki-style world map built and maintained by millions of volunteers — locals who know their areas best. This community effort results in highly detailed maps, often more accurate than commercial ones in less-mapped regions. Organic Maps updates its data from OpenStreetMap every two weeks, keeping your maps fresh and reliable. And if you notice something missing, you can add it to OpenStreetMap and help improve the map for everyone.

<b>PRIVACY-FIRST:</b> We don’t collect any data or identifiers. This means there’s no risk of data leaks and no distractions like ads or noisy notifications — just a clean, private map experience.

<b>IMPORTANT FEATURES</b>

<b>EXPLORE PLACES:</b> Search by address, name, or category, discover millions of POIs, and view detailed information such as opening hours, Wikipedia articles, wheelchair accessibility, and other helpful details.

<b>GPS NAVIGATION:</b> Enjoy voice-guided, turn-by-turn directions. Create walking, hiking, cycling, or driving routes — including routes between cities, countries, and multiple waypoints. Find the best routes for your metro journeys and commutes. Android Auto is supported.
