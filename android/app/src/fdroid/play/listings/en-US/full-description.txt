Organic Maps is a navigation app with privacy, for drivers, hikers, and cyclists. It has no location tracking, no data collection, and no ads, so you can take control of your data. Search, routing and navigation operates without a cell phone signal, ideal for distant hiking trails or locations with poor connections. Organic Maps uses the crowd-sourced OpenStreetMap data with contributors from all over the globe. The project is community-driven, the code is open-source, and prioritizes community development and collaboration.
