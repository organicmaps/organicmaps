I've just released gflags 1.4.  This release has only minor changes
from 1.3, including some documentation tweaks and some work to make
the library smaller.  If 1.3 is working well for you, there's no
particular reason to upgrade.

===4 January 2010===

I've just released gflags 1.3.  gflags now compiles under MSVC, and
all tests pass.  I *really* never thought non-unix-y Windows folks
would want gflags, but at least some of them do.

The major news, though, is that I've separated out the python package
into its own library, [http://code.google.com/p/python-gflags python-gflags].
If you're interested in the Python version of gflags, that's the place to
get it now.

I've just released gflags 1.2.  The major change from gflags 1.1 is it
now compiles under MinGW (as well as cygwin), and all tests pass.  I
never thought Windows folks would want unix-style command-line flags,
since they're so different from the Windows style, but I guess I was
wrong!

The other changes are minor, such as support for --htmlxml in the
python version of gflags.

===15 April 2009===

I've just released gflags 1.1.  It has only minor changes fdrom gflags
1.0 (see the
[http://code.google.com/p/google-gflags/source/browse/tags/gflags-1.1/ChangeLog
ChangeLog] for details).  The major change is that I moved to a new
system for creating .deb and .rpm files.  This allows me to create
x86_64 deb and rpm files.

In the process of moving to this new system, I noticed an
inconsistency: the tar.gz and .rpm files created libraries named
libgflags.so, but the deb file created libgoogle-gflags.so.  I have
fixed the deb file to create libraries like the others.  I'm no expert
in debian packaging, but I believe this has caused the package name to
change as well.  Please let me know (at
[mailto:google-gflags@googlegroups.com
google-gflags@googlegroups.com]) if this causes problems for you --
especially if you know of a fix!  I would be happy to change the deb
packages to add symlinks from the old library name to the new
(libgoogle-gflags.so -> libgflags.so), but that is beyond my knowledge
of how to make .debs.

If you've tried to install a .rpm or .deb and it doesn't work for you,
let me know.  I'm excited to finally have 64-bit package files, but
there may still be some wrinkles in the new system to iron out.

===1 October 2008===

gflags 1.0rc2 was out for a few weeks without any issues, so gflags
1.0 is now released.  This is much like gflags 0.9.  The major change
is that the .h files have been moved from `/usr/include/google` to
`/usr/include/gflags`.  While I have backwards-compatibility
forwarding headeds in place, please rewrite existing code to say
{{{
   #include <gflags/gflags.h>
}}}
instead of
{{{
   #include <google/gflags.h>
}}}

I've kept the default namespace to google.  You can still change with
with the appropriate flag to the configure script (`./configure
--help` to see the flags).  If you have feedback as to whether the
default namespace should change to gflags, which would be a
non-backwards-compatible change, send mail to
`google-gflags@googlegroups.com`!

Version 1.0 also has some neat new features, like support for bash
commandline-completion of help flags.  See the
[http://code.google.com/p/google-gflags/source/browse/tags/gflags-1.0rc2/ChangeLog
ChangeLog] for more details.

If I don't hear any bad news for a few weeks, I'll release 1.0-final.
