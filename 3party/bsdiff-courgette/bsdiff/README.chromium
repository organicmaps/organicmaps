Description:
This directory contains an extensively modified version of Colin Percival's
bsdiff, available in its original form from:

   http://www.daemonology.net/bsdiff/

The basic principles of operation are best understood by reading Colin's
unpublised paper:

Colin Percival, Naive differences of executable code, http://www.daemonology.net/bsdiff/, 2003.

The copy on this directory so extensively modified that the binary format is
incompatible with the original and it cannot be compiled outside the Chromium
source tree or the Courgette project.

List of changes made to original code:
  - Wrapped functions in 'bsdiff' namespace.
  - Renamed .c files to .cc files.
  - Added bsdiff.h and bsdiff_search.h header files.
  - Changed the code to use streams.h from Courgette.
  - Changed the encoding of numbers to use the 'varint' encoding.
  - Reformatted code to be closer to Google coding standards.
  - Renamed variables.
  - Added comments.
  - Fixed search() comparison issue: http://crbug.com/620867.
  - Replaced QSufSort with modified version of libdivsufsort.
