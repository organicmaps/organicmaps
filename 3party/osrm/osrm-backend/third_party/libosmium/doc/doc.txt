 * Osmium is a fast and flexible C++ library for working with OpenStreetMap
 * data.
 *
 * This is the API documentation that was automatically created from the
 * source code. For more information about the Osmium Library see
 * http://osmcode.org/libosmium .
 *
 * Osmium is free software and available under the Boost Software License.
 * The source code is available at https://github.com/osmcode/libosmium .
 *
 * Osmium is a header-only library. You do not need to compile and link it,
 * just include the headers you need.
 *
 * Everything in namespaces called "detail" is for internal Osmium use only,
 * do not depend on it in your code. Do not include any include files in
 * directories named "detail" directly. Include files in directories called
 * "experimental" and everything in namespaces called "experimental" is
 * unsupported and may change at any time regardless of the status of the rest
 * of the library.
