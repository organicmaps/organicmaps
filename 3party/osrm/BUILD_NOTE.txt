If you youse luabind library with a version lesser than 0.9.2,
you may have troubles compiling OSRM code with a boost >=1.57
(more details here: https://github.com/luabind/luabind/issues/27 ).

You can fix it either by using latest luabind from source https://github.com/rpavlik/luabind
or https://github.com/DennisOSRM/luabind, or by applying the following patch
to /usr/include/luabind/object.hpp:
