Version 1.3
===========

Released 2010-06-13

* New encoding flags:

  - ``JSON_PRESERVE_ORDER``: Preserve the insertion order of object
    keys.

* Bug fixes:

  - Fix an error that occured when an array or object was first
    encoded as empty, then populated with some data, and then
    re-encoded

  - Fix the situation like above, but when the first encoding resulted
    in an error

* Documentation:

  - Clarify the documentation on reference stealing, providing an
    example usage pattern


Version 1.2.1
=============

Released 2010-04-03

* Bug fixes:

  - Fix reference counting on ``true``, ``false`` and ``null``
  - Estimate real number underflows in decoder with 0.0 instead of
    issuing an error

* Portability:

  - Make ``int32_t`` available on all systems
  - Support compilers that don't have the ``inline`` keyword
  - Require Autoconf 2.60 (for ``int32_t``)

* Tests:

  - Print test names correctly when ``VERBOSE=1``
  - ``test/suites/api``: Fail when a test fails
  - Enhance tests for iterators
  - Enhance tests for decoding texts that contain null bytes

* Documentation:

  - Don't remove ``changes.rst`` in ``make clean``
  - Add a chapter on RFC conformance


Version 1.2
===========

Released 2010-01-21

* New functions:

  - `json_equal()`: Test whether two JSON values are equal
  - `json_copy()` and `json_deep_copy()`: Make shallow and deep copies
    of JSON values
  - Add a version of all functions taking a string argument that
    doesn't check for valid UTF-8: `json_string_nocheck()`,
    `json_string_set_nocheck()`, `json_object_set_nocheck()`,
    `json_object_set_new_nocheck()`

* New encoding flags:

  - ``JSON_SORT_KEYS``: Sort objects by key
  - ``JSON_ENSURE_ASCII``: Escape all non-ASCII Unicode characters
  - ``JSON_COMPACT``: Use a compact representation with all unneeded
    whitespace stripped

* Bug fixes:

  - Revise and unify whitespace usage in encoder: Add spaces between
    array and object items, never append newline to output.
  - Remove const qualifier from the ``json_t`` parameter in
    `json_string_set()`, `json_integer_set()` and `json_real_set`.
  - Use ``int32_t`` internally for representing Unicode code points
    (int is not enough on all platforms)

* Other changes:

  - Convert ``CHANGES`` (this file) to reStructured text and add it to
    HTML documentation
  - The test system has been refactored. Python is no longer required
    to run the tests.
  - Documentation can now be built by invoking ``make html``
  - Support for pkg-config


Version 1.1.3
=============

Released 2009-12-18

* Encode reals correctly, so that first encoding and then decoding a
  real always produces the same value
* Don't export private symbols in ``libjansson.so``


Version 1.1.2
=============

Released 2009-11-08

* Fix a bug where an error message was not produced if the input file
  could not be opened in `json_load_file()`
* Fix an assertion failure in decoder caused by a minus sign without a
  digit after it
* Remove an unneeded include of ``stdint.h`` in ``jansson.h``


Version 1.1.1
=============

Released 2009-10-26

* All documentation files were not distributed with v1.1; build
  documentation in make distcheck to prevent this in the future
* Fix v1.1 release date in ``CHANGES``


Version 1.1
===========

Released 2009-10-20

* API additions and improvements:

  - Extend array and object APIs
  - Add functions to modify integer, real and string values
  - Improve argument validation
  - Use unsigned int instead of ``uint32_t`` for encoding flags

* Enhance documentation

  - Add getting started guide and tutorial
  - Fix some typos
  - General clarifications and cleanup

* Check for integer and real overflows and underflows in decoder
* Make singleton values thread-safe (``true``, ``false`` and ``null``)
* Enhance circular reference handling
* Don't define ``-std=c99`` in ``AM_CFLAGS``
* Add C++ guards to ``jansson.h``
* Minor performance and portability improvements
* Expand test coverage


Version 1.0.4
=============

Released 2009-10-11

* Relax Autoconf version requirement to 2.59
* Make Jansson compile on platforms where plain ``char`` is unsigned
* Fix API tests for object


Version 1.0.3
=============

Released 2009-09-14

* Check for integer and real overflows and underflows in decoder
* Use the Python json module for tests, or simplejson if the json
  module is not found
* Distribute changelog (this file)


Version 1.0.2
=============

Released 2009-09-08

* Handle EOF correctly in decoder


Version 1.0.1
=============

Released 2009-09-04

* Fixed broken `json_is_boolean()`
