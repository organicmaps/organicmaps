<h1>MapsWithMe Android API: Getting Started</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>MapsWithMe Android API (hereinafter referred to as <em>&quot;API Library&quot;</em> or just <em>&quot;library&quot;</em>)
provides interface for client application to perform next tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Show one or more points on offline map of <a href="http://mapswith.me/" title="MapsWithMe">MapsWithMe Application</a></li>
<li>Come back to the client application after selecting specific point on the map, by sending <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/PendingIntent.html" title="PendingIntent">PendingIntent</a> with point data when user asks for more information by pressing &quot;More Info&quot; button in MapsWithMe Application</li>
<li>Map screen brending : your application&#39;s icon and name (or custom title) will be placed at the top.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, you can provide <strong>two way communication between your appication and MapsWithMe</strong>,
using MapsWithMe to show points of interest (POI) and providing more information in your app.</p>

<p>Please refer to <a href="sample-app-capitals" title="Api Source Code">sample application</a> for demo.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>It is supposed that you are familiar with Android Development, and you have Android SDK and Eclipse (or another IDE of your choice) installed.
You should be familiar with concept of <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters.html" title="Intents and Intent Filters">Intents</a>, <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/index.html#LibraryProjects" title="Android Library Project">library projects</a>, and <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/PendingIntent.html" title="PendingIntent">PendingIntents</a> (recommended) as well.
Your application must target at least <em>android sdk version 7</em>.</p>

<h2>Integration</h2>

<p>First step is to clone <a href="https://github.com/mapswithme/api-android" title="GitHub Repository">repository</a> or download it as an archive.</p>

<p>When your are done you find two folders: <em>lib</em> and <em>sample-app-capitals</em>. First one is a library project that you should add to your project.
You don&#39;t need any additional permissions in your AndroidManifest.xml to use API library, so you can write real code straight away, calling for different <code>MapsWithMeApi</code> methods (more details below). </p>

<h2>Classes Overview and HOW TO</h2>

<p>Core classes you will work with are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="lib/src/com/mapswithme/maps/api/MapsWithMeApi.java" title="MapsWithMeApi.java">com.mapswithme.maps.api.MapsWithMeApi</a> - static class with methods such as <code>showPointOnMap(Activity, double, double, String)</code> etc.</li>
<li><a href="lib/src/com/mapswithme/maps/api/MWMPoint.java" title="MWMPoint.java">com.mapswithme.maps.api.MWMPoint</a> - model of POI, includes lat, lon, name, and id data.</li>
<li><a href="lib/src/com/mapswithme/maps/api/MWMResponse.java" title="MWMResponse.java">com.mapswithme.maps.api.MWMResponse</a> - helps you to extract response from MapsWithMe by applying <code>MWMResponse.extractFromIntent(Intent)</code> to Intent. Contains MWMPoint data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Show Points on the Map</h3>

<p>The simplest usage:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyPerfectActivity extends Activity {
...

  void showSomethingOnTheMap(SomeDomainObject arg)
  {
    // Do some work, create lat, lon, and name for point
    final double lat = ...;
    final double lon = ...;
    final String name = ...;
    // Ask MapsWithMe to show the point
    MapsWithMeApi.showPointOnMap(this, lat, lon, name);
  }
...

}
</code></pre>

<p>For multiple points use <a href="lib/src/com/mapswithme/maps/api/MWMPoint.java" title="MWMPoint.java">MWMPoint</a> class:</p>

<pre><code>void showMultiplePoints(List&lt;SomeDomainObject&gt; list)
{
  // Convert objects to MMWPoints
  final MWMPoint[] points = new MWMPoint[list.length];
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; list.size; i++)
  {
    // Get lat, lon, and name from object and assign it to new MMWPoint
    points[i] = new MWMPoint(lat, lon, name);
  }
  // Show all point on the map, you could also provide some title
  MapsWithMeApi.showPointsOnMap(this, &quot;Look at my points, my points are amazing!&quot;, points);
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Ask MapsWithMe to Call my App</h3>

<p>We support PendingIntent interaction (just like Android native
NotificationManager does). You should specify ID for each point to
diftiguish it leter, and PentingIntent that MapsWithMe will send back to
your application when user press &quot;More Info&quot; button :</p>

<pre><code>// Here is how to pass points with ID ant PendingIntent
void showMultiplePointsWithPendingIntent(List&lt;SomeDomainObject&gt; list, PendingIntent pendingIntent)
{
  // Convert objects to MMWPoints
  final MWMPoint[] points = new MWMPoint[list.length];
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; list.size; i++)
  {
    //                                      ||
    //                                      ||
    //                                      \/
    //         Now you should specify string ID for each point
    points[i] = new MWMPoint(lat, lon, name, id);
  }
  // Show all points on the map, you could also provide some title
  MapsWithMeApi.showPointsOnMap(this, &quot;This title says that user should choose some point&quot;, pendingIntent, points);
}

//Code below shows general way to extract response data
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
    // Handle intent you specified with PandingIntent
    // Now it has additional information (MWMPoint).
    handleIntent(getIntent());
}

@Override
protected void onNewIntent(Intent intent)
{
  super.onNewIntent(intent);
  // if defined your activity as &quot;SingleTop&quot;- you should use onNewIntent callback
  handleIntent(intent);
}

void handleIntent(Intent intent)
{
  // Apply MWMResponse extraction method to intent
  final MWMResponse mwmResponse = MWMResponse.extractFromIntent(this, intent);
  // Here is your point that user selected
  final MWMPoint point = mwmResponse.getPoint();
  // Now, for instance you can do some work depending on point id
  processUserInteraction(point.getId());
}
</code></pre>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h4>How should I detect if user has MapsWithMe installed?</h4>

<p><code>MapsWithMeApi.isMapsWithMeInstalled(Context)</code> will return <code>true</code> if user has <em>Lite</em> or <em>Pro</em> version that supports API call installed.</p>

<h4>Which versions of MapsWithMe support API calls?</h4>

<p>Both <em>Lite</em> and <em>Pro</em> versions since 2.4.0 are support API calls.</p>

<h4>What will happen if I call for <code>MapsWithMeApi.showPoint()</code> but MapsWithMe application is not installed?</h4>

<p>Nothing serious. API library will show simple dialog with gentle offer to download MapsWithMe. You can see how it looks like below. <img src="site/images/dlg.png" alt="Please install us"></p>

<h4>If user has both <em>Lite</em> and <em>Pro</em> versions which one will be called?</h4>

<p>MapsWithMe Pro will serve your request in the case if both <em>Lite</em> and <em>Pro</em> versions installed. </p>
