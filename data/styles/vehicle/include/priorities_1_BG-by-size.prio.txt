# This file is automatically re-formatted and re-sorted in priorities descending order
# when generate_drules.sh is run. All comments (automatic priorities of e.g. optional captions, drule types visibilities, etc.)

# BG-by-size geometry: background areas rendered below BG-top and everything else.
# Smaller areas are rendered above larger ones (area's size is estimated as the size of its' bounding box).
# So effectively priority values of BG-by-size areas are not used at the moment.
# But we might use them later for some special cases, e.g. to determine a main area type of a multi-type feature.
# Keep them in a logical importance order please.

# Priorities ranges' rendering order overview:
# - overlays (icons, captions...)
# - FG: foreground areas and lines
# - BG-top: water (linear and areal)
# - BG-by-size: landcover areas sorted by their size
