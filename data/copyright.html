  <p>Version 2.1, February 1999</p>

  <p>Copyright &copy; 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br />
  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br />
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br />
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br /></p>

  <p>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public
  License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]</p>

  <h3>Preamble</h3>

  <p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU
  General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software &mdash; to make sure the
  software is free for all its users.</p>

  <p>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages &mdash; typically
  libraries &mdash; of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest
  you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to
  use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</p>

  <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are
  designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if
  you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces
  of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.</p>

  <p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask
  you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
  copies of the library or if you modify it.</p>

  <p>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients
  all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link
  other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they
  know their rights.</p>

  <p>We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license,
  which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</p>

  <p>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also,
  if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the
  original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced
  by others.</p>

  <p>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a
  company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent
  holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with
  the full freedom of use specified in this license.</p>

  <p>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license,
  the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the
  ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries
  into non-free programs.</p>

  <p>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two
  is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License
  therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public
  License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.</p>

  <p>We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than
  the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over
  competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
  libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.</p>

  <p>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain
  library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the
  library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this
  case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public
  License.</p>

  <p>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to
  use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many
  more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.</p>

  <p>Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user
  of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified
  version of the Library.</p>

  <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the
  difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived
  from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.</p>

  <h3>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h3>

  <p><strong>0.</strong> This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a
  notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this
  Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".</p>

  <p>A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with
  application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</p>

  <p>The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A
  "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a
  work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
  straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
  "modification".)</p>

  <p>"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library,
  complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
  files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.</p>

  <p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its
  scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered
  only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
  writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library
  does.</p>

  <p><strong>1.</strong> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you
  receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
  absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.</p>

  <p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
  protection in exchange for a fee.</p>

  <p><strong>2.</strong> You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work
  based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
  that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>a)</strong> The modified work must itself be a software library.</li>

    <li><strong>b)</strong> You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the
    files and the date of any change.</li>

    <li><strong>c)</strong> You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under
    the terms of this License.</li>

    <li>
      <strong>d)</strong> If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied
      by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked,
      then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function
      or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

      <p>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined
      independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table
      used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must
      still compute square roots.)</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived
  from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
  and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the
  same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the
  terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every
  part regardless of who wrote it.</p>

  <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you;
  rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
  the Library.</p>

  <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on
  the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
  License.</p>

  <p><strong>3.</strong> You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this
  License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer
  version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version
  instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.</p>

  <p>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public
  License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</p>

  <p>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a
  library.</p>

  <p><strong>4.</strong> You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in
  object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the
  complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
  above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.</p>

  <p>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering
  equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source
  code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>

  <p><strong>5.</strong> A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work
  with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in
  isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</p>

  <p>However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the
  Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is
  therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</p>

  <p>When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code
  for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is
  especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</p>

  <p>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and
  small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of
  whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will
  still fall under Section 6.)</p>

  <p>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the
  terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked
  directly with the Library itself.</p>

  <p><strong>6.</strong> As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the
  Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms
  of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications.</p>

  <p>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and
  its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays
  copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing
  the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the
    Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above);
    and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the
    Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a
    modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of
    definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified
    definitions.)</li>

    <li><strong>b)</strong> Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism
    is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than
    copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the
    library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that
    the work was made with.</li>

    <li><strong>c)</strong> Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same
    user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this
    distribution.</li>

    <li><strong>d)</strong> If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place,
    offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.</li>

    <li><strong>e)</strong> Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have
    already sent this user a copy.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility
  programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be
  distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
  itself accompanies the executable.</p>

  <p>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do
  not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library
  together in an executable that you distribute.</p>

  <p><strong>7.</strong> You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single
  library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library,
  provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is
  otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library,
    uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.</li>

    <li><strong>b)</strong> Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based
    on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>8.</strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly
  provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
  is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
  compliance.</p>

  <p><strong>9.</strong> You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing
  else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited
  by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on
  the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
  distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.</p>

  <p><strong>10.</strong> Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient
  automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
  subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
  rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>

  <p><strong>11.</strong> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any
  other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
  License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
  pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or
  indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely
  from distribution of the Library.</p>

  <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of
  the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>

  <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to
  contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
  software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous
  contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of
  that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other
  system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</p>

  <p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this
  License.</p>

  <p><strong>12.</strong> If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by
  patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in
  or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
  body of this License.</p>

  <p><strong>13.</strong> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General
  Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ
  in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>

  <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License
  which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
  version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license
  version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>

  <p><strong>14.</strong> If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution
  conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted
  by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
  promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>

  <p><strong>NO WARRANTY</strong></p>

  <p><strong>15.</strong> BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE
  EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
  PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
  LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
  QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
  NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>

  <p><strong>16.</strong> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT
  HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
  DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO
  USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
  PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
