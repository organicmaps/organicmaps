  <p>Version 2.1, February 1999</p>

  <p>Copyright &copy; 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br />
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br />
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br />
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br /></p>

  <p>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public
    License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]</p>

  <h3>Preamble</h3>

  <p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU
    General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software &mdash; to make sure the
    software is free for all its users.</p>

  <p>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages &mdash; typically
    libraries &mdash; of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest
    you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to
    use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</p>

  <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are
    designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if
    you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces
    of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.</p>

  <p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask
    you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
    copies of the library or if you modify it.</p>

  <p>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients
    all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link
    other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
    with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they
    know their rights.</p>

  <p>We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license,
    which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</p>

  <p>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also,
    if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the
    original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced
    by others.</p>

  <p>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a
    company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent
    holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with
    the full freedom of use specified in this license.</p>

  <p>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license,
    the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the
    ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries
    into non-free programs.</p>

  <p>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two
    is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License
    therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public
    License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.</p>

  <p>We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than
    the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over
    competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
    libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.</p>

  <p>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain
    library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the
    library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this
    case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public
    License.</p>

  <p>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to
    use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many
    more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.</p>

  <p>Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user
    of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified
    version of the Library.</p>

  <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the
    difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived
    from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.</p>

  <h3>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h3>

  <p><strong>0.</strong> This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a
    notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this
    Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".</p>

  <p>A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with
    application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</p>

  <p>The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A
    "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a
    work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
    straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
    "modification".)</p>

  <p>"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library,
    complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
    files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.</p>

  <p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its
    scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered
    only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
    writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library
    does.</p>

  <p><strong>1.</strong> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you
    receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
    absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.</p>

  <p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
    protection in exchange for a fee.</p>

  <p><strong>2.</strong> You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work
    based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
    that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>a)</strong> The modified work must itself be a software library.</li>

    <li><strong>b)</strong> You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the
      files and the date of any change.</li>

    <li><strong>c)</strong> You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under
      the terms of this License.</li>

    <li>
      <strong>d)</strong> If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied
      by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked,
      then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function
      or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

      <p>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined
        independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table
        used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must
        still compute square roots.)</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived
    from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
    and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the
    same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the
    terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every
    part regardless of who wrote it.</p>

  <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you;
    rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
    the Library.</p>

  <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on
    the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
    License.</p>

  <p><strong>3.</strong> You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this
    License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
    that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer
    version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version
    instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.</p>

  <p>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public
    License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</p>

  <p>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a
    library.</p>

  <p><strong>4.</strong> You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in
    object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the
    complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
    above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.</p>

  <p>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering
    equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source
    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>

  <p><strong>5.</strong> A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work
    with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in
    isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</p>

  <p>However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the
    Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is
    therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</p>

  <p>When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code
    for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is
    especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
    threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</p>

  <p>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and
    small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of
    whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will
    still fall under Section 6.)</p>

  <p>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the
    terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked
    directly with the Library itself.</p>

  <p><strong>6.</strong> As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the
    Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms
    of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
    engineering for debugging such modifications.</p>

  <p>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and
    its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays
    copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing
    the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the
      Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above);
      and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the
      Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a
      modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of
      definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified
      definitions.)</li>

    <li><strong>b)</strong> Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism
      is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than
      copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the
      library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that
      the work was made with.</li>

    <li><strong>c)</strong> Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same
      user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this
      distribution.</li>

    <li><strong>d)</strong> If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place,
      offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.</li>

    <li><strong>e)</strong> Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have
      already sent this user a copy.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility
    programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be
    distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
    itself accompanies the executable.</p>

  <p>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do
    not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library
    together in an executable that you distribute.</p>

  <p><strong>7.</strong> You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single
    library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library,
    provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is
    otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library,
      uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.</li>

    <li><strong>b)</strong> Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based
      on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>8.</strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly
    provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
    is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
    or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
    compliance.</p>

  <p><strong>9.</strong> You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing
    else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited
    by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on
    the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
    distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.</p>

  <p><strong>10.</strong> Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient
    automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
    subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
    rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>

  <p><strong>11.</strong> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any
    other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
    License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
    pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or
    indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely
    from distribution of the Library.</p>

  <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of
    the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>

  <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to
    contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
    software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous
    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of
    that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other
    system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</p>

  <p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this
    License.</p>

  <p><strong>12.</strong> If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by
    patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
    an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in
    or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
    body of this License.</p>

  <p><strong>13.</strong> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General
    Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ
    in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>

  <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License
    which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
    version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license
    version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>

  <p><strong>14.</strong> If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution
    conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted
    by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
    promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>

    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
    However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf
    and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,
    and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
    harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
    Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
    liability.</p>

  <p>Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.</p>

  <p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

  <h3 id="preamble">Preamble</h3>

  <p>This license establishes the terms under which a given free software Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development of that Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and free software.</p>

  <p>You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing arrangement.</p>

  <h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>

  <p>"Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.</p>

  <p>"Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's procedures.</p>

  <p>"You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or modify the Package.</p>

  <p>"Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.</p>

  <p>"Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others outside of your company or organization.</p>

  <p>"Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It does not mean licensing fees.</p>

  <p>"Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.</p>

  <p>"Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.</p>

  <p>"Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.</p>

  <p>"Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and configuration files for the Package.</p>

  <p>"Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the Source form.</p>

  <h3 id="permission_for_use_and_modification_without_distribution">Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution</h3>

  <p>(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not Distribute the Modified Version.</p>

  <h3 id="permissions_for_redistribution_of_the_standard_version">Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version</h3>

  <p>(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.</p>

  <p>(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to the Original License.</p>

  <h3 id="distribution_of_modified_versions_of_the_package_as_source">Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source</h3>

  <p>(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:</p>

  <p>(a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version.<br />
    (b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard Version.<br />
    (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others under<br />
    (i) the Original License or<br />
    (ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed.<br /></p>

  <h3 id="distribution_of_compiled_forms">Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions without the Source</h3>

  <p>(5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.</p>

  <p>(6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of the Modified Version.</p>

  <h3 id="aggregating_or_linking_the_package">Aggregating or Linking the Package</h3>

  <p>(7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.</p>

  <p>(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.</p>

  <h3 id="items_that_are_not_considered_part_of_a_modified_version">Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version</h3>

  <p>(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license.</p>

  <h3 id="general_provisions">General Provisions</h3>

  <p>(10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.</p>

  <p>(11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.</p>

  <p>(12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.</p>

  <p>(13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.</p>

  <p>(14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.</p>

  <h2 id="freetype-license">The FreeType Project License</h2>

  <p>2006-Jan-27</p>

  <p>Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg</p>



  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
    some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
    various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
    FreeType Project.</p>

  <p>This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
    which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
    affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
    documentation and makefiles, at the very least.</p>

  <p>This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
    (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
    and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
    alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:</p>

  <ul><li>We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
    interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)</li>

    <li>You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)</li>

    <li>You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
      FreeType code. (`credits')</li></ul>

  <p>We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
    software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
    We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
    assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.</p>


  <p>Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
    credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
    encourage you to use the following text:</p>

  <p>
    Portions of this software are copyright &copy; &lt;year&gt; The FreeType
    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
  </p>

  <p>Please replace &lt;year&gt; with the value from the FreeType version you
    actually use.</p>


  <h3>Legal Terms</h3>

  <h4>0. Definitions</h4>

  <p>Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
    and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
    distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
    Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
    beta or final release.</p>

  <p>`You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
    `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
    code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
    This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
    engine'.</p>

  <p>This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
    FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
    documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
    original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
    If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
    this license, you must contact us to verify this.</p>

  <p>The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
    Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
    specified below.</p>

  <h4>1. No Warranty</h4>

  <p>THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
    KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
    WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
    BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
    USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.</p>

  <h4>2. Redistribution</h4>

  <p>This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
    irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
    display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
    sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
    forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
    authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
    herein, subject to the following conditions:</p>

  <ul><li>Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
    (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
    the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
    documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
    original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
    files.</li>

    <li>Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.</li></ul>

  <p>These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
    the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
    our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
    to us.</p>

  <h4>3. Advertising</h4>

  <p>Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
    the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
    purposes without specific prior written permission.</p>

  <p>We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
    following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
    or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
    `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.</p>

  <p>As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
    accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
    material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
    authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
    Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
    Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
    of this license.</p>

  <h4>4. Contacts</h4>

  <p>There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:</p>

  <ul><li>freetype@nongnu.org<br><br>

    Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as
    future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.
    If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you
    haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.</li>

    <li>freetype-devel@nongnu.org<br><br>

  <p>Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007</p>
  <h3> PREAMBLE</h3>

  <p>The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide<br />
    development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation<br />
    efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and<br />
    open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership<br />
    with others.</p>
  <p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and<br />
    redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The<br />
    fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, <br />
    redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved<br />
    names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,<br />
    however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The<br />
    requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply<br />
    to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>
  <h3> DEFINITIONS</h3>

  <p>"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical<br />
    writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.</p>
  <h3>PERMISSION &amp; CONDITIONS</h3>

    a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,<br />
    redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font<br />
    Software, subject to the following conditions:</p>
  <p>1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,<br />
    in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.</p>
  <p>2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,<br />
    redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy<br />
    contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be<br />
    included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or<br />
    in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or<br />
    binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.</p>

    Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as<br />
    presented to the users.</p>
  <p>4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font<br />
    Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any<br />

    must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be<br />
    distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to<br />
    remain under this license does not apply to any document created<br />
    using the Font Software.</p>

  <p>The Licensor grants you a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive licence to use the Information subject to the conditions below. </p>

  <p resource="[cc:Notice]"> &nbsp;Contains public sector information licensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0.</p>

  <p>If you are using Information from several Information Providers and listing multiple attributions is not practical in your product or application, you may include a URI or hyperlink to a resource that contains the required attribution statements.</p>
  <p>These are important conditions of this licence and if you fail to comply with them the rights granted to you under this licence, or any similar licence granted by the Licensor, will end automatically.</p>

  <h3>Exemptions</h3>
  <p>This licence does not cover:</p>
  <li>personal data in the Information;</li>
  <li>Information that has not been accessed by way of publication or disclosure under information access legislation (including the Freedom of Information Acts for the UK and Scotland) by or with the consent of the Information Provider;</li>

  <h3>No warranty</h3>
  <p>The Information is licensed 'as is' and the Information Provider and/or Licensor excludes all representations, warranties, obligations and liabilities in relation to the Information to the maximum extent permitted by law. </p>
  <p>The Information Provider and/or Licensor are not liable for any errors or omissions in the Information and shall not be liable for any loss, injury or damage of any kind caused by its use. The Information Provider does not guarantee the continued supply of the Information.</p>

  <h3>Governing Law</h3>
  <p>This licence is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Information Provider has its principal place of business, unless otherwise specified by the Information Provider.</p>

  <h3>Definitions</h3>
  <p>In this licence, the terms below have the following meanings:</p>

  <p>'Information' means information protected by copyright or by database right (for example, literary and artistic works, content, data and source code) offered for use under the terms of this licence. </p>

  <p>'Information Provider' means the person or organisation providing the Information under this licence.</p>

  <p>'Licensor' means any Information Provider which has the authority to offer Information under the terms of this licence or the Keeper of Public Records, who has the authority to offer Information subject to Crown copyright and Crown database rights and Information subject to copyright and database right that has been assigned to or acquired by the Crown, under the terms of this licence.</p>

  <p>'Use' means doing any act which is restricted by copyright or database right, whether in the original medium or in any other medium, and includes without limitation distributing, copying, adapting, modifying as may be technically necessary to use it in a different mode or format.</p>

  <p>'You', 'you' and 'your' means the natural or legal person, or body of persons corporate or incorporate, acquiring rights in the Information (whether the Information is obtained directly from the Licensor or otherwise) under this licence.</p>

  <h3> About the Open Government Licence</h3>

  <p>The National Archives has developed this licence as a tool to enable Information Providers in the public sector to license the use and re-use of their Information under a common open licence. The National Archives invites public sector bodies owning their own copyright and database rights to permit the use of their Information under this licence.</p>

  <p>The Keeper of the Public Records has authority to license Information subject to copyright and database right owned by the Crown. The extent of the offer to license this Information under the terms of this licence is set out in <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/re-use-and-licensing/ukglf/">the UK Government Licensing Framework</a>.</p>

  <p>This is version 3.0 of the Open Government Licence. The National Archives may, from time to time, issue new versions of the Open Government Licence.  If you are already using Information under a previous version of the Open Government Licence, the terms of that licence will continue to apply.</p>

  <p>These terms are compatible with the Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0 and the Open Data Commons Attribution License, both of which license copyright and database rights.  This means that when the Information is adapted and licensed under either of those licences, you automatically satisfy the conditions of the OGL when you comply with the other licence.  The OGLv3.0 is Open Definition compliant.</p>

  <p>Further context, best practice and guidance can be found in the <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/uk-government-licensing-framework/">UK Government Licensing Framework section</a> on The National Archives website.</p>

    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT
    PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES
    NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS
    PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE
    COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS
    DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND
    DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF
    THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
    HEREUNDER.
  </div>

  <p>The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world
    automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights
    (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each
    and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or
    a database (each, a "Work").</p>
    <p>Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights
    to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of
    creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the
    public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
    infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works,
    reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
    whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation
    commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the
    Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
    production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to
    gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part
    through the use and efforts of others.</p>
    <p>For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and
    without any expectation of additional consideration or
    compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the
    "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of
    Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects
    to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work
    under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and
    Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
    effect of CC0 on those rights.</p>
    <p><strong>1. Copyright and Related Rights.</strong>
    A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by
    copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
     Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but
    are not limited to, the following:
    </p>
    <ol type="i">
    <li>the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform,
    display, communicate, and translate a Work;</li>
    <li> moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
    performer(s);</li>
    <li>publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's
    image or likeness depicted in a Work;</li>
    <li>rights protecting against unfair competition in regards
    to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a),
    below;</li>
    <li>rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and
    reuse of data in a Work;</li>
    <li>database rights (such as those arising under Directive
    96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
    March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under
    any national implementation thereof, including any amended
    or successor version of such directive); and</li>
    <li>other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights
    throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and
    any national implementations thereof.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>2. Waiver.</strong> To the greatest extent
    permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law,
    Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
    unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
    Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims
    and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including
    existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
    the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
    maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
    (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
    future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
    purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
    advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer
    makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public
    at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
    successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be
    subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination,
    or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
    enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by
    Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
    </p>
    <p><strong>3. Public License Fallback.</strong> Should any
    part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or
    ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be
    preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
    Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
    extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each
    affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non
    sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional
    license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights
    in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
    maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
    (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
    future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
    purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
    advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The
    License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
    applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
    License for any reason be judged legally invalid or
    ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
    ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the
    License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or
    she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
    Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any
    associated claims and causes of action with respect to the
    Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement
    of Purpose.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Limitations and Disclaimers.</strong></p>
    <ol type="a">
    <li>No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are
    waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise
    affected by this document.</li>
    <li>Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no
    representations or warranties of any kind concerning the
    Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including
    without limitation warranties of title, merchantability,
    fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the
    absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present
    or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.</li>
    <li>Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of
    other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof,
    including without limitation any person's Copyright and
    Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims
    responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents,
    permissions or other rights required for any use of the
    Work.</li>
    <li>Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative
    Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or
    obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.</li>

For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.</p>
  <p><strong>4. Restrictions.</strong>The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: </p>
  <ol type="a">
  <li>
  You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.
  </li>
  <li>
  You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License, a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons license that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Japan). You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License or other license specified in the previous sentence with every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License.
  </li>
  <li>
  If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer</strong></p>
  <p>UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE MATERIALS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
  <p><strong>6. Limitation on Liability.</strong> EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. </p>
  <p><strong>7. Termination</strong> </p>
  <ol type="a">
  <li>
  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
  </li>
  <li>
  Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>8. Miscellaneous</strong> </p>
  <ol type="a">
  <li>
  Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
  </li>
  <li>
  Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
  </li>
  <li>
  If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
  </li>
  <li>
  No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
  </li>
  <li>
  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

  the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works,
  such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,
  arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary
  or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and
  includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in
  which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted
  including in any form recognizably derived from the
  original, except that a work that constitutes a
  Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the
  purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt,
  where the Work is a musical work, performance or
  phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
  timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
  considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this
  License.</li>

  literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and
  anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts,
  or other works or subject matter other than works listed
  in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection
    and arrangement of their contents, constitute
  intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in
  its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more
  other contributions, each constituting separate and
  independent works in themselves, which together are
  assembled into a collective whole. A work that
  constitutes a Collection will not be considered an
  Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of this
  License.</li>
  <li><strong>"Creative Commons Compatible
  License"</strong> means a license that is listed at
  https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has
  been approved by Creative Commons as being essentially

  same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements
  of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the
  relicensing of adaptations of works made available under
  that license under this License or a Creative Commons
  jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as
  this License.</li>

  who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other
  sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the
  organization that transmits the broadcast.</li>
  <li><strong>"Work"</strong> means the literary and/or
  artistic work offered under the terms of this License
  including without limitation any production in the
  literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be

  form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a
  lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same
  nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a
  choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a
  musical composition with or without words; a
  cinematographic work to which are assimilated works
  expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a
  work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture,
  engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which
  are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
  photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map,
  plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to
  geography, topography, architecture or science; a
  performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of
  data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable
  work; or a work performed by a variety or circus
  performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a

  <li><strong>"You"</strong> means an individual or entity
  exercising rights under this License who has not
  previously violated the terms of this License with
  respect to the Work, or who has received express
  permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
  this License despite a previous violation.</li>

  Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by
  them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or
  process and the communication to the public of the

  means including signs, sounds or images.</li>
  <li><strong>"Reproduce"</strong> means to make copies of
  the Work by any means including without limitation by

  </ol>
  <p><strong>2. Fair Dealing Rights.</strong> Nothing in this
  License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses
  free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
  exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
  copyright protection under copyright law or other
  applicable laws.</p>
  <p><strong>3. License Grant.</strong> Subject to the terms
  and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You
  a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
  the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
  exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:</p>
  <ol type="a">
  <li>to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
  one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as
  incorporated in the Collections;</li>
  <li>to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any
  such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium,
  takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or
  otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
  Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
  original work was translated from English to Spanish," or
  a modification could indicate "The original work has been
  modified.";</li>
  <li>to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including
  as incorporated in Collections; and,</li>
  <li>to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.</li>
  <li>
  <p>For the avoidance of doubt:</p>
  <ol type="i">
  <li><strong>Non-waivable Compulsory License
  Schemes</strong>. In those jurisdictions in which the
  right to collect royalties through any statutory or
  compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the
  Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
  royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
  granted under this License;</li>
  <li><strong>Waivable Compulsory License
  Schemes</strong>. In those jurisdictions in which the
  right to collect royalties through any statutory or
  compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the
  Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such
  royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
  granted under this License; and,</li>
  <li><strong>Voluntary License Schemes</strong>. The
  Licensor waives the right to collect royalties,
  whether individually or, in the event that the
  Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
  administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that
  society, from any exercise by You of the rights
  granted under this License.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  </ol>
  <p>The above rights may be exercised in all media and
  formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above
  rights include the right to make such modifications as are
  technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
  and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
  expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.</p>
  <p><strong>4. Restrictions.</strong> The license granted in
  Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
  the following restrictions:</p>
  <ol type="a">
  <li>You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only
  under the terms of this License. You must include a copy
  of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this
  License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
  Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
  on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or
  the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
  rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
  License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
  intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
  disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
  Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
  Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
  effective technological measures on the Work that
  restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You
  to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
  the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to
  the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
  not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to
  be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
  create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
  must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
  Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as
  requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from
  any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
  from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section
  4(c), as requested.</li>
  <li>You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation
  only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later
  version of this License with the same License Elements as
  this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction
  license (either this or a later license version) that
  contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
  Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons
  Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under
  one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply
  with the terms of that license. If you license the
  Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses
  mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable
  License"), you must comply with the terms of the
  Applicable License generally and the following
  provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI
  for, the Applicable License with every copy of each
  Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You
  may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that
  restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the
  ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise
  the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
  the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all
  notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the
  disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as
  included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly
  Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
  Adaptation, You may not impose any effective
  technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict
  the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to
  exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
  terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b)
  applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a
  Collection, but this does not require the Collection
  apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to
  the terms of the Applicable License.</li>
  <li>If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or
  any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a
  request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep
  intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
  reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
  the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
  applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author
  and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
  a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
  attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's
  copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
  means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title
  of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
  practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to
  be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
  refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
  for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b),
  in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the
  use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French
  translation of the Work by Original Author," or
  "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
  The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be
  implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
  that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a
  minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all
  contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection
  appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at
  least as prominent as the credits for the other
  contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may
  only use the credit required by this Section for the
  purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,
  by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not
  implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection
  with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
  Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of
  You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,
  express prior written permission of the Original Author,
  Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.</li>
  <li>Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor
  or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if
  You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
  either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
  Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
  take other derogatory action in relation to the Work
  which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor
  or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
  jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the
  right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right
  to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
  mutilation, modification or other derogatory action
  prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and
  reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
  appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
  permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You
  to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of
  this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
  otherwise.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>5. Representations, Warranties and
  Disclaimer</strong></p>
  <p>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN
  WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
  REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
  WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
  WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
  FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE
  ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE
  PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
  WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
  <p><strong>6. Limitation on Liability.</strong> EXCEPT TO
  THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
  LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
  SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
  DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
  EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
  SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
  <p><strong>7. Termination</strong></p>
  <ol type="a">
  <li>This License and the rights granted hereunder will
  terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
  terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
  received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
  License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
  provided such individuals or entities remain in full
  compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
  and 8 will survive any termination of this License.</li>
  <li>Subject to the above terms and conditions, the
  license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of
  the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
  the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
  Work under different license terms or to stop
  distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
  any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
  (or any other license that has been, or is required to
  be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
  License will continue in full force and effect unless
  terminated as stated above.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>8. Miscellaneous</strong></p>
  <ol type="a">
  <li>Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
  or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
  license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as
  the license granted to You under this License.</li>
  <li>Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an
  Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
  the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
  license granted to You under this License.</li>
  <li>If any provision of this License is invalid or
  unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
  the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
  terms of this License, and without further action by the
  parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
  reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
  provision valid and enforceable.</li>
  <li>No term or provision of this License shall be deemed
  waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
  consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be
    charged with such waiver or consent.</li>
  <li>This License constitutes the entire agreement between
  the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There
  are no understandings, agreements or representations with
  respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
  not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear
  in any communication from You. This License may not be
  modified without the mutual written agreement of the
  Licensor and You.</li>
  <li>The rights granted under, and the subject matter
  referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the
  terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
  Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
  1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
  Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
  Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as
  revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject
  matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which
  the License terms are sought to be enforced according to
  the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
  those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.
  If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
  copyright law includes additional rights not granted
  under this License, such additional rights are deemed to
  be included in the License; this License is not intended
  to restrict the license of any rights under applicable
  law.</li>

    if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as
    the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and

To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.</p>
    <p><strong>Section 1 – Definitions.</strong></p>
    <ol type="a">
    <li><strong>Adapted Material</strong> means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor.

    <li><strong>Copyright and Similar Rights</strong> means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.</li>
    <li><strong>Effective Technological Measures</strong> means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not
    be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar
    international agreements.</li>
    <li><strong>Exceptions and Limitations</strong> means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.</li>
    <li><strong>Licensed Material</strong> means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.</li>
    <li><strong>Licensed Rights</strong> means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.</li>

    <li><strong>Share</strong> means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.</li>
    <li><strong>Sui Generis Database Rights</strong> means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.</li>

    <p><strong>Section 2 – Scope.</strong></p>
    <ol type="a">

    <ol>
    <li>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
    <ol type="A">
    <li>reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and</li>
    <li>produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Exceptions and Limitations</span>. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.</li>
    <li>Term</span>. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).</li>
    <li>Media and formats; technical modifications allowed</span>. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.</li>
    <li>Downstream recipients</span>.
    <div class="para">
    <ol type="A">
    <li>Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material</span>. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.</li>
    <li>No downstream restrictions</span>. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.</li>
    </ol>
    </div>
    <li>No endorsement</span>. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).</li>
    </ol>
    <li><p><strong>Other rights</strong>.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.</li>
    <li>Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.</li>
    <li>To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Section 3 – License Conditions.</strong></p>
    <p>Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.</p>

    <li>retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:
    <ol type="i">
    <li>identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);</li>
    <li>a copyright notice;</li>
    <li>a notice that refers to this Public License; </li>

    <li>indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License,
    and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public
    License.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.</li>
    <li>If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.</li>
      <li>If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.</strong></p>
    <p>Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:</p>
    <ol type="a">
    <li>for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;</li>
    <li>if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and</li>
    <li>You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.</li>
    </ol>
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
    <p><strong>Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.</strong></p>
    <ol style="font-weight: bold;" type="a">
    <li><strong>Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="3" type="a">
    <li>The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Section 6 – Term and Termination.</strong></p>
    <ol type="a">
    <li>This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.</li>
    <li>
    <p>Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or</li>
    <li>upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.</li>
    </ol>
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.</li>
    <li>For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.</li>
    <li>Sections 8 survive termination of this Public License.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.</strong></p>
    <ol type="a">
    <li>The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.</li>
    <li>Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Section 8 – Interpretation.</strong></p>
    <ol type="a">
    <li>For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.</li>
    <li>To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.</li>
    <li>No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.</li>
    <li>Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.</li>
