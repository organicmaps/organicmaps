We write code without warnings!

In general, Google's coding standard http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml is used and we strongly encourage to read it.

Below are our specific exceptions to the Google's coding standard:

- We use .cpp and .hpp files, not .cc and .h (.c and .h are used for C code), in UTF-8 encoding
- File names are lowercase with underscores, like file_reader.cpp
- We use #pragma once instead of the #define Guard
- We don't include system, std and boost headers directly, use #include "../std/<wrapper.hpp>"
- We ARE using C++ exceptions
- We don't support C++11 yet
- We don't use boost libraries which require linking


Naming and formatting

- We ALWAYS use two spaces indent and don't use tabs
- We don't have hardcoded line width, but keep it reasonable to fit on the screen
- Doxygen-style comments can be used
- Underscores are allowed only in prefixes for member variables and namespace names, like int m_countriesCount; namespace utf_parser
- Don't specify std:: and boost:: prefixes (headers in std/ folder already have 'using std::string')
- Use right-to-left order for variables/params: string const & s (reference to the const string)
- In one line 'if', 'for', 'while' we do not use brackets. If one line 'for' or 'while' is combined with one line 'if' do use brackets for cycle.
- Space after the keyword in conditions and loops. Space after ';' in for loop
- Space between binary operators, but can skip according to operators priority: x = y*y + z*z;
- Space after double dash

Tips and Hints

- Cover your code with unit tests! See examples for existing libraries
- Check Base and Coding libraries for most of the basic functions
- Ask your team if you have any questions
- Use dev@ mailing list to ask all developers and bugs@ mailing list to post bugs
- Release builds contain debugging information (for profiling), production builds are not
- If you don't have enough time to make it right, leave a // @TODO need to fix it comment
- Some useful macroses:
-- #ifdef DEBUG | RELEASE | OMIM_PRODUCTION
-- #ifdef OMIM_OS_ANDROID | OMIM_OS_IPHONE | OMIM_OS_MAC (and some other useful OS-related macroses, see std/target_os.hpp)
-- Use ASSERT(expression, (out message)) and ASSERT_XXXXXX macroses often to check code validity in DEBUG builds
-- Use CHECK(expression, (out message)) and CHECK_XXXXXX macroses to check code validity in all builds
-- Use LOG(level, (message)) for logging, below is more detailed description for level:
   LINFO - always prints log message
   LDEBUG - logs only in DEBUG
   LWARNING - the same as LINFO but catches your attention
   LERROR - the same as LWARNING, but crashes in DEBUG and works in RELEASE
   LCRITICAL - the same as LERROR and ALWAYS crashes
-- Need scope guard? Check MY_SCOPE_GUARD(name, func)
-- Calculate array size with ARRAY_SIZE(arrayVariable)
-- Declare your own exceptions with DECLARE_EXCEPTION(name, baseException), where baseException is usually RootException
-- Throw exceptions with MYTHROW(exceptionName, (message))
-- A lot of useful string conversion utils are in base/string_utils.hpp
