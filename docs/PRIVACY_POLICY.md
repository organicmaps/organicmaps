# Privacy Policy

The Organic Maps project doesn't collect personal identifying information and doesn't track its users.

Personal information might be collected only when a user chooses so, e.g. crash reports are sent to OM developers for users who opted-in to be beta-testers.
Organic Maps might collect anonymous usage statistics in a privacy-preserving way. These stats couldn't possibly be used to identify or track a user. We'll disclose all such cases.

All personal information is also reasonably protected by default from third parties.
There are additional options for sensitive users to further enhance protection by sacrificing some convenience / ease of use (e.g. disable search history).
Please keep in mind there are technical limits on what protection OM could possibly offer, e.g. usually phone's system software is controlled by its vendor and there could be firmware bits controlled by hardware manufacturers.

The project might explore various monetization options, but all of them should be done in a such way as to preserve privacy, honor, dignity, and respect for users.
