# Translations

## Help us to review/proofread translations

You can join our [GitHub translation teams](https://github.com/orgs/organicmaps/teams/translations/teams),
so any contributor can tag all teams (or a specific language team) to get help with the review.

Please respond in the relevant [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/orgs/organicmaps/discussions/8538), or let us know at hello@organicmaps.app

## Contribute translations directly

Adding and updating translations is easy!
1. Change the translation file you want, e.g. [strings.txt](../data/strings/strings.txt) ([raw text version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/master/data/strings/strings.txt))
2. Commit your string changes with the title `[strings] {description of changes}`
3. (Optional) run the `tools/unix/generate_localizations.sh` script
4. (Optional) Commit the updated files with the title `[strings] Regenerated`
5. Send a pull request!

Please make sure to add a [Developers Certificate of Origin](CONTRIBUTING.md#legal-requirements) to your commit descriptions.

## Requirements

To run the `tools/unix/generate_localizations.sh` script, it is necessary to have installed `ruby`.

## Translation files

- Main:
  - Application UI strings: [`data/strings/strings.txt`](../data/strings/strings.txt)
  - A few iOS specific strings: [`iphone/plist.txt`](../iphone/plist.txt)

- POI Categories:
  - Names of map features/types: [`data/strings/types_strings.txt`](../data/strings/types_strings.txt)
  - Search keywords/aliases/synonyms for map features: [`data/categories.txt`](../data/categories.txt)

  The POI definitions in the [OpenStreetMap Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/) help finding the most suitable translation. Both POI files should be kept in sync, so make sure that every category name is also contained in the coresponding search keyword list. Strings in _categories.txt_ should, however, not contain common tokens like e.g. Shop, Store or Center as separate words.

- Additional:
  - Text-to-speech strings for navigation: [`data/strings/sound.txt`](../data/strings/sound.txt)

  - Android stores description: [`android/app/src/fdroid/play/`](../android/app/src/fdroid/play/)
  - Apple App Store description: [`iphone/metadata/`](../iphone/metadata/)

  - Popular brands of map features: [`data/strings/brands_strings.txt`](../data/strings/brands_strings.txt)
  - Search keywords for popular brands: [`data/categories_brands.txt`](../data/categories_brands.txt)
  - Search keywords for cuisine types: [`data/categories_cuisines.txt`](../data/categories_cuisines.txt)

  - Country / map region names: [`data/countries_names.txt`](../data/countries_names.txt)

  - [other strings](STRUCTURE.md#strings-and-translations) files

Language codes used are from [ISO 639-1 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).
If a string is not translated into a particular language then it falls back to English or a "parent" language (e.g. `es-MX` falls back to `es`).

## Tools

To find strings without translations substitute `ar` with your language code and run the following script:
```
tools/python/strings_utils.py -l ar -pm
```
By default, it searches `strings.txt`, to check `types_strings.txt` add a `-t` option.
There are many more other options, e.g. print various translation statistics, validate and re-format translation files.
Check `tools/python/strings_utils.py -h` to see all of them.

To check consistency of types_strings.txt with categories.txt run:
```
ruby tools/ruby/category_consistency/check_consistency.rb
```

## Automatic translations

In some cases automatically translated strings are better than no translation at all.
There are two scripts to automate given string's translation into multiple languages.
Please [install Translate Shell](https://www.soimort.org/translate-shell/#installation) first to be able to run them.

### DeepL + Google Translate fallback

The first one uses free DeepL API where possible and provides a significantly better quality translations.
It requires registering a [DeepL account](https://www.deepl.com/pro#developer) and [getting API key](https://www.deepl.com/account/summary).
You may be asked for a credit card for verification, but it won't be charged.
Requires Python version >= 3.7.

```bash
export DEEPL_FREE_API_KEY=<your DeepL API key here>
# Generates translations in both categories.txt and strings.txt formats at the same time:
tools/python/translate.py English text to translate here
# Use two-letter language codes with a colon for a non-English source language:
tools/python/translate.py de:German text to translate here
```

### Google Translate only

The second one is not recommended, it uses Google API and sometimes translations are incorrect.
Also it does not support European Portuguese (pt or pt-PT), and always generates Brazil Portuguese.

```bash
# Generates translations in categories.txt format
tools/unix/translate_categories.sh "Route"
# Translations in strings.txt format
DELIM=" = " tools/unix/translate_categories.sh "Route"
```

## Technical details

Most of the translation files (strings, types_strings...) are in Twine file format ([syntax reference](https://github.com/organicmaps/twine/blob/organicmaps/README.md)).
OM uses a custom version of the [Twine](https://github.com/organicmaps/twine)
tool (resides in `tools/twine/` submodule) to generate platform-native (Android, iOS)
localization files from a single translation file.

The `tools/unix/generate_localizations.sh` script launches this conversion
(and installs Twine beforehand if necessary).

Search keywords translation files use a custom format described in the beginning of `data/categories.txt`.

A `tools/python/clean_strings_txt.py` script is used to sync `strings.txt` with real UI strings usage as found in the codebase.

There are preliminary plans to refactor translations workflow and migrate to Weblate.
