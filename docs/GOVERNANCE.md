# Governance

The Organic Maps project is community-driven and has little hierarchy.

## [The Board](GOVERNANCE/BOARD.md)
Ensures the project stays within its [Mission and Core Values](CORE_VALUES.md),
legally hosts project's assets like trademarks, domains, finances etc. and handles legal enquiries.
See [details](GOVERNANCE/BOARD.md) of Board's structure and responsibilities.

## [Teams](GOVERNANCE/TEAMS.md)

Day-to-day work and decisions are made by the teams of active contributors ("the doers") in their area of expertise, e.g. Android development, translations or devops, see [the full list of Teams](GOVERNANCE/TEAMS.md).

At the moment there is no formal process to resolve non-technical disputes (e.g. UX disagreements or whether a proposed change fits into OM at all),
but there are some common sense guidelines / recommendations:
  - strive to address all reasonable concerns
  - ask more contributors and experts on the matter to provide their opinion
  - refer to users' feedback, e.g. include the change into an alpha version or poll via communication channels
  - usually an incremental improvement is better than no change at all, create separate issues for follow-up concerns
  - give benefit of a doubt to the actual "doers" who commit their energy into code, designs, etc.
