# Free and Open Source Policy

The complete Organic Maps project codebase and all associated tools, documents and resources are released using [FSF or OSI approved](https://spdx.org/licenses/) FOSS licenses[^1]. OM doesn't require contributors to assign their copyrights, so that its much harder to take over the project and change to a proprietary license.

All data comes from open sources[^2] (e.g. map data is based on OpenStreetMap).

We strive to use FOSS tools and platfroms for collaboration when possible. There are some notable exceptions, e.g. Github (https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/issues/7059). Contributors are free to use whatever individual tools they're used to (e.g. proprietary IDEs).

The development process is open: e.g. a full commit history is available in repositories, all Github PRs and issues are open and we strive to conduct as much discussions in public as possible.

[^1]: At the moment non-F-Droid Android builds of OM contain a proprietary Google Play Services Location library, which possibly could be replaced by a FOSS implementation in the future (see #9916).
Please let us know if you spot any other non-free bits.
