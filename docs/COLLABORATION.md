# Collaboration

## Principles

### Voluntary Work

Organic Maps welcomes all volunteer contributors from any domain. Volunteer Contributors work at their own pace. Please be prepared for volunteer work to be carried out in a more spontaneous or unstructured manner.

### Funded Work

Organic Maps obtains donations and grant funding from public institutions to support new feature development. Please expect such work to be structured as projects with clear scope, deadlines, assigned teams, and a person in charge.

### Interactivity

The objective is to merge all contributions as soon as they are ready and meet the merge criteria. However, certain changes may require expertise from individuals who are unavailable or busy with other tasks that have deadlines. Please be patient and collaborate on the provided comments to ensure all required criteria are met.

### Priorities

The roadmap is more of a collection of funded or expected-to-be-funded projects. Voluntary work is difficult to plan, and features and bug fixes may arise out of order. The team will make every effort to organize work in key areas, completing all preliminary product and UI/UX tasks to ensure they are ready for execution by volunteers.

### Publicity

All development communication should occur through public channels, avoiding direct messages and private chats whenever possible. Any decision made must be documented in writing within the ticket, ensuring that the motivation and reasoning are clear and understandable to all.

### Artifacts

Collaboration should be conducted in a way that produces tangible artifacts, such as tickets, design mockups, pull requests, and other relevant documentation. Chatting in messaging platforms (e.g., Telegram) often leads to time wastage and does not generate artifacts. Please respect your time and the time of others by prioritizing the creation of artifacts over generating chat logs.

### Tools

Contributors and teams are free to choose the tools that best suit their needs. However, priority should be given to open-source tools that align with the project's philosophy. Using proprietary tools is fully acceptable as long as they help achieve the desired results more efficiently. This project is primarily focused on developing a mobile maps app. Any gaps in open-source tooling in other areas should be addressed outside the scope of this project.

### Code of Conduct

The community follows the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). to maintain a respectful, inclusive, and collaborative environment for all participants. It promotes mutual respect, constructive communication, and diversity while discouraging harassment and discrimination. All members are expected to adhere to these guidelines, and any violations will be addressed according to the outlined procedures, ensuring a positive and supportive space for everyone.
