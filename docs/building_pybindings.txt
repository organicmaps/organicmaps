Some of the project's librariers (traffic, search, kml and others) come
with python bindings, i.e. have some of their functions exposed to be
callable from the python programming language. The version of python
is not enforced, so some libraries may be using python 2 and some may
be using python 3.

This document describes how to build these python bindings.


Preparing source tree
---------------------
The CoMaps project comes with its own version of Boost (https://www.boost.org/)
in a submodule. You have to recursively update submodules before you start
building anything.

Ensure you have ran:

  $ git submodule update --init --recursive



Building single pybinding module
--------------------------------
Find a correspoding module's setup.py.
Currently available modules and setup's:
| module      | path to setup.py                       |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| pygen       | generator/pygen/setup.py               |
| pykmlib     | kml/pykmlib/setup.py                   |
| pymvm_diff  | generator/mwm_diff/pymwm_diff/setup.py |
| pysearch    | search/pysearch/setup.py               |
| pytracking  | tracking/pytracking/setup.py           |
| pytraffic   | traffic/pytraffic/setup.py             |

Run the chosen setup.py with Python you want to build binding for.
Examples:

  $ python kml/pykmlib/setup.py build install --user
  $ python3.6 generator/mwm_diff/pymwm_diff/setup.py bdist_wheel 

During build, our setup.py will configure and build boost_python library for
needed Python version, configure omim, and build needed binding.


Building all pybindings modules
-------------------------------
Run generic pyhelpers/setup.py with needed Python. This will invoke build (or
other actions) for all pybindings.


Supported actions and options
-----------------------------
Please refer to setuptools/distutils documentation for description of all
available commands.
Main commands are:
 build
 install
 bdist_wheel

Notable option for build command:

  --omim-builddir [path to omim builddir]

It should be used to store build dir somewhere outside source tree. If not
specified, everything will be build in directory `build` from current
directory.

Complete wheels generation example:
  $ python3.7 pyhelpers/setup.py build --omim-builddir ../omim-build/ bdist_wheel

This will create wheels for all pybindings in `../omim-build/pybindings-dist/`.


Pip installation
----------------
One can install pybinding straight from source:

  $ pip install git+https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps.git@master#egg=pykmlib&subdirectory=kml/pykmlib

But this can be a long wait, it is better to use already compiled .whl
distribution.


Running and testing a pybinding
-------------------------------
Install your freshly built pybinding either with `setup.py install`, or by
installing .whl with `pip install`.

Run tests:

  MWM_RESOURCES_DIR=data \
  MWM_WRITABLE_DIR=data \
  search/pysearch/run_search_engine.py

Problems and solutions
----------------------
1. Building bindings on MacOS Catalina 10.15.5.
   If you try to build one of the bindings on MacOS Catalina with Apple clang
   version 11.0.3 you'll see the error that the flag fcoalesce-templates is not
   supported. The workaround is to remove this flag from
   3party/boost/tools/build/src/tools/darwin.jam and
   3party/boost/tools/build/src/tools/darwin.py

2. You may get build errors that standard C++ headers can't be found while
   building of Boost.Python. For example, fatal error: 'cstddef' file not found.
   In that case the following flags should be set to correct values:
   MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET, CC, CXX, CFLAGS. For example, instead of launching:

    $ python3.7 kml/pykmlib/setup.py build --omim-builddir=kml/pykmlib/cmake-build-release

   should be launched:

    $ MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9 CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS='-stdlib=libc++'
      python3.7 kml/pykmlib/setup.py build --omim-builddir=kml/pykmlib/cmake-build-release
