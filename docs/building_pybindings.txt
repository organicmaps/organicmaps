Some of the project's librariers (traffic, search, kml and others) come
with python bindings, i.e. have some of their functions exposed to be
callable from the python programming language. The version of python
is not enforced, so some libraries may be using python 2 and some may
be using python 3.

This document describes how to build these python bindings.


Installing Boost.Python
-----------------------

The MAPS.ME project comes with its own version of Boost (https://www.boost.org/)
in a submodule. While most of the project uses boost in the header-only mode,
you will need to build the Boost.Python library to link against if you need
python bindings.

Once you've run

  $ git submodule update --init --recursive

and

  $ ./configure.sh

from omim's root directory, you'll have the Boost headers installed but the
python library will not be built by default, so we'll need to build it
manually. (The less clean alternative is to
link against the version of library installed in your system in case you have
a system installation of Boost. This is not recommended.)

The official instruction for Boost 1.68 is here: https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_68_0/libs/python/doc/html/building/configuring_boost_build.html.

Here is a recap.

Write the paths to your python binary, headers and libraries in a .jam-file.
We will edit the auto-generated file omim/3party/boost/project-config.jam
which omim's configure.sh should have generated by now.
Unfortunately, Boost's bootstrap.sh (called from omim's configures.sh) that generates
this file is not sufficiently versatile to allow us provide the necessary paths
at the ./configure.sh stage.

We will append the python config to the end of project-config.jam.
Boost.Build does not work well with duplicating "using python" rules for the same
version so if you've made a mistake, manually edit the file instead of appending
a version with corrected paths.

Example for a macOS installation:

    $ pwd

    /omim/3party/boost

    $ cat >>project-config.jam <<EOF

using python
  : 3.7
  : /usr/local/opt/python3/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin/python3
  : /usr/local/opt/python3/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/Headers
  : /usr/local/opt/python3/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib
  ;
EOF

    $ ./b2 --with-python python=3.7 --build-dir=build-python37 cxxflags="-fPIC"

(On some systems "-fPIC" is not needed)

The syntax is
    using python : <version> : <python binary> : <path to python headers> : <path to python libraries> ;

Newlines are allowed, semicolon is required.
If there are several versions of Boost.Python that you want to build,
they can all be added to the same .jam-file with this "using python" directive.

If you want to remove the python libraries, you'll have to do it by manually removing
the build directory. (b2 provides a "--clean" flag which seems to be broken)

   $ pwd

    /omim/3party/boost

   $ rm -r build-python37



Building pybindings
-------------------

Now you're ready to build omim's CMake targets that link against Boost.Python.

Do not forget to clean CMake's caches (by purging the build/ directory, for example)
if something goes wrong during the CMake stage.

    $ pwd

    /omim

    $ mkdir ../build-omim
    $ cd ../build-omim
    $ cmake ../omim \
       -DPYBINDINGS=ON \
       -DPYBINDINGS_VERSION=9.5.0 \
       -DPYTHON_VERSION=3.7.5

    (make sure that the version match what you've provided in the .jam file
     when building the Boost.Python lib)

    $ make -j4 pysearch

If the above invocation of CMake fails to find the correct
python installation on your system, you may need to help it:

     $ cmake ../omim \
         -DPYBINDINGS=ON \
         -DPYBINDINGS_VERSION=9.5.0 \
         -DPYTHON_VERSION=3.7.5 \
         -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/opt/python3/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin/python3 \
         -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/opt/python3/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/Headers \
         -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/local/opt/python3/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/libpython3.7m.dylib


Test your newly built target:

    $ MWM_RESOURCES_DIR=../omim/data \
      MWM_WRITABLE_DIR=..omim/data \
      PYTHONPATH=. \
      ../omim/search/pysearch/run_search_engine.py
