# Core Values
Shared by a broader community of the Organic Maps project developers and users.

- **Free and Open Source**
<br>The complete codebase and associated resources are released under Free and Open Source Software licenses and development happens in an open and transparent way. Refer to the [policy](FOSS_POLICY.md) for details and minor exceptions.
- **Privacy**
<br>No personal information is collected by default. And we make a reasonable effort to protect it from third parties. Check the [Privacy Policy][PRIVACY_POLICY.md] for details.
- **Community**
<br>The project is based on a broad community of volunteer contributors be it developers or donors or users answering each others questions and promoting OM to friends. And we're proud to be a part of a bigger OpenStreetMap community.
<br>The project endeavours to have little hierarchy in its governance and strives to conduct as much discussion in public as possible.
- **Core qualities of user-facing Organic Maps apps:**
  - Easy to use
  - Offline-centric
  - OpenStreetMap integration
  - Fast and light on resources
  - Respectful
  <br>privacy by default, no annoying ads, no agressive monetization
